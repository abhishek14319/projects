        <h2>ABOUT VIVEKANANDA IN BRIEF :</h2>
        <ul type="square">
            <li>Swami Vivekananda, (12 January 1863 â€“ 4 July 1902),
                 born Narendranath Datta, was an Indian Hindu monk, 
                 philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the 
                 chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna. <br><br></li>

            <li>He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta
                and Yoga to the Western world and is credited with 
                raising interfaith awareness, and bringing Hinduism 
                to the status of a major world religion.<br><br></li>

            <li>Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in 
                Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young age 
                towards religion and spirituality. He later found his 
                guru, Ramakrishna, and became a monk.<br><br></li>  
                
            <li> After the death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda extensively
                toured the Indian subcontinent, acquiring first-hand 
                knowledge of the living conditions of Indian people in 
                then British India. <br><br></li>
                
            <li>Moved by their plight, he resolved to help his 
                countrymen and found a way to travel to the United 
                States, where he became a popular figure after the 
                1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago, in which 
                he began his famous speech with the words: Sisters 
                and brothers of America... before introducing 
                Hinduism to Americans<br><br></li>  
                
            <li>He was so impactful at the Parliament that an 
                American newspaper described him as "an orator 
                by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure 
                at the Parliament"<br><br></li>  
                
            <li>After great success at the Parliament, in the subsequent 
                years, Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures across 
                the United States, England and Europe, disseminating the 
                core tenets of Hindu philosophy, and founded the Vedanta 
                Society of New York and the Vedanta Society of San 
                Francisco (now Vedanta Society of Northern California),
                both of which became the foundations for Vedanta 
                Societies in the West.<br><br></li> 
                
            <li>In India, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math, 
                which provides spiritual training for monastics and 
                householder devotees, and the Ramakrishna Mission that 
                provides charity, social work and education.<br><br></li>    

            <li>Vivekananda was one of the most influential philosophers 
                and social reformers in his contemporary India, and the 
                most successful missionaries of Vedanta to the Western world.<br><br></li>
                
            <li>He was also a major force in contemporary Hindu reform 
                movements, and contributed to the concept of nationalism 
                in colonial India.<br><br></li> 
                
            <li>He is now widely regarded as one of the most influential 
                people of modern India and a patriotic saint. His birthday 
                in India is celebrated as National Youth Day.<br><br></li>
